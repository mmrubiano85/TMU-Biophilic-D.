'Designing a biophilic ventilated façade involves considering aspects such as the location and size of windows, the design of solar protection elements, and the selection of appropriate materials. Here is a more in-depth analysis of these aspects:\n' +
'<br>\n' +
'\n' +
'Location and size of windows: The positioning of windows must be strategic to maximize natural light and take advantage of views towards green or natural spaces. It is advisable to place windows on facades facing south or north (depending on the hemisphere), avoiding, if possible, facades exposed to the west or east, where direct solar radiation can be more intense. The size of the windows should also be balanced, avoiding them from being too large, causing overheating, or too small, limiting the entry of light.\n' +

'Design of brise-soleil elements: Solar protection elements, such as brise-soleil, should be designed to provide shade during peak solar radiation hours, reducing heat gain inside the building. These elements can be horizontal or vertical structures, and their placement and angle will depend on the sun's position during different times of the year. Various materials, such as wood, metal, or composite materials, can be used for brise-soleil, offering both aesthetics and functionality.\n' +

'Types of ventilation: Concerning ventilation, various systems can be integrated into the façade, such as cross ventilation, which allows natural airflow through the building, and controlled mechanical ventilation, which utilizes heat recovery or heat exchangers to improve energy efficiency. The selection of the system will depend on factors like geographical location, climate, and specific project requirements.\n' +

'Harnessing sunlight: In addition to windows, other elements can be used to capture sunlight, such as skylights. Skylights are roof windows that allow natural light to reach interior spaces that would otherwise be dark. These elements are particularly useful in multi-level buildings, where they can bring natural light to lower floors.\n' +

'Modern materials for a biophilic project: In a biophilic project, it is essential to choose materials that are sustainable, environmentally friendly, and provide a natural look. Some modern options include certified wood facades, integrated solar panels, low-emissivity glass cladding to improve thermal insulation, mechanical ventilation systems with heat recovery, and recycled materials for construction.\n' +

'1. Visual Connection with Nature:<br>\n' +
'This pattern in the building is achieved through terraces and connecting bridges between the POD and the Kerr Hall. From these areas, the pathway of Nelson Mandela can be appreciated, highlighting its importance and giving it a sense of hierarchy. Having this kind of pattern here, especially when the terraces are located in spaces like the library and some classrooms, relaxes the eyes and reduces cognitive stress.\n' +

'2. Dynamic & Diffuse Light:<br>\n' +
'Through these same connecting bridges and skylights, the building attracts as much sunlight as possible throughout the day, making circulation spaces comfortable for both staying and transitioning. Natural light makes people feel alive, improves their well-being, and energizes them, resulting in a better-balanced mood and enhanced productivity.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +

'3. Non-rhythmic sensory stimuli:<br>\n' +
'The library is not only a space for studying but it is important for it to create a comfortable environment for concentration and, in some cases, relaxation. Having different types of ambiances and elements like green murals evoke feelings of not being confined in a space. The mind becomes interested in momentary sensations that produce pleasure, relaxation, calmness, and overall well-being.\n' +

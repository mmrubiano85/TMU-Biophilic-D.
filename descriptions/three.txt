'1. Material Connection with Nature:<br>\n' +
'Despite integrating modern elements, the building preserves its original materials (stone and brick), creating a warm and inviting ambiance. This evokes a connection with nature, providing comfort, tactile stimulation, calmness, and eliciting cognitive and psychological responses. The colors and shapes make occupants feel "at home" and visually, it is more appealing and creatively attractive than a plain brick wall. Additionally, this approach can contribute to environmental friendliness.\n' +

'2. Thermal & Airflow Variability:<br>\n' +
'The building features a spacious double-height area culminating in a large skylight on the roof. This design is essential for creating comfortable spaces that simulate outdoor sensations. The voids offer a refreshing, active, and lively atmosphere, ensuring natural ventilation and improving the air quality for people passing through the space. The design also adapts to ventilation needs, enhancing occupants' overall comfort.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'3. Mystery:<br>\n' +
'The building's entrance evokes a sense of mystery through the contrast of colors with the original materials, inviting visitors to explore new spaces. This exploration and understanding of the spaces intrigue people, as they are uncertain about what to expect, leading to surprises that develop their cognitive skills.\n' +

'ANALYSIS:<br>\n' +
'Let's remember that it's possible to propose various design approaches in the interior space to achieve an interesting contrast with the facade. While the building may appear old from the outside, the same holds true on the inside. However, upon entering, a contrast is felt. The use of rustic, aged, and heritage materials like brick, combined with minimalist interior design and a color palette that evokes a sense of being in a different place, makes this space intriguing and comfortable for concentration, studying, or working.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'The fact that the architecture is old doesn't mean it has to remain that way throughout its entire lifespan. Fortunately, there are resources and ways to change the interior environment, modernize it, and make the most of it, without erasing history.\n' +

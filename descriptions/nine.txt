'PATTERNS:<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'\n' +
'1. Non-Visual Connection with Nature:<br>\n' +
'The building's configuration emphasizes spacious and important corridors, not only for circulation but also for integration with the facade. The long shape and material of the facade enable a direct connection with the exterior, fostering a relationship with the rest of the campus beyond serving as a mere covering element.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'2. Connection with Natural Systems:<br>\n' +
'The engineering building features a rooftop farm, providing access to nature without the need to seek it elsewhere. This green roof not only raises awareness of the importance of green spaces in the city but also encourages utilizing natural elements to produce food while reducing the carbon footprint.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'3. Dynamic & Diffuse Light:<br>\n' +
'The engineering building boasts a large boardroom with a central double-height space and a skylight, allowing ample natural light to enter and diffuse throughout. The strategic use of artificial light only when necessary and the facade acting as a conduit for interior light provide people with dual benefits while utilizing the corridors.\n' +

'ANALYSIS:<br>\n' +
'The engineering building concentrates all its enclosed spaces inwards, allowing the areas where students gather to be spacious and well-lit, promoting focus and concentration. Additionally, it features a rooftop farm that serves as a market for people every Tuesday, contributing to carbon footprint reduction. Moreover, the building includes a double-height boardroom, providing a sense of spaciousness, freshness, light, and serenity in the space.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'I relate this to the Non-Visual Connection with Nature, Connection with Natural Systems, and Dynamic & Diffuse Light, as these factors collaborate to serve the building's function, working together to create a precise environment for its use, incorporating some biophilic patterns in its design from a biophilic perspective.\n' +
'\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'Natural light plays a fundamental role, as it enhances people's concentration. Ensuring well-lit spaces for prolonged stays and optional circulation paths contribute to the perception of space and the sensations and comfort it conveys.\n' +

'1. Presence of Water:<br>\n' +
'The campus features a small circular plaza that serves as a public space. Having this element here naturally brings harmony and captivation. It provides several benefits to visitors and pedestrians, improving their sensory experience. Additionally, it gives the campus a unique vibe and serves as a space for gathering.\n' +

'2. Non-Rhythmic Sensory Stimuli:<br>\n' +
'This pattern introduces stimuli in both the interior and exterior spaces, especially on floors 4 and 6 of the SLC building, where different ecosystems are brought to life. Observing nature, hearing its sounds, feeling its textures, and smelling its scents are part of the experience provided by this pattern. It extends beyond just the physical space, encompassing everything in it, such as furniture, colors, structure, ceiling, light, and the creation of small spaces within the larger area.\n' +
'<br><br>\n' +
'\n' +
'3. Thermal & Airflow Variability:<br>\n' +
'The building itself creates various conditions through its facade and installations. The height of each floor and visible pipe facilities without the need for a ceiling offer the possibility of enjoying a spacious environment, regardless of the number of people present. Expanding the perception of thermal comfort can help reduce energy demands. The ventilation system and use of glass and blinds contribute to a comfortable experience.\n' +

'QUAD:<br>\n' +
'In a large campus like that of TMU, located in the city center, having gathering spaces is highly beneficial as it promotes diversity among people and hosts various events. The QUAD serves as a versatile hub for activities such as skateboarding and ice skating during winter, or rollerblading in summer or spring. Additionally, it functions as a captivating water feature, greatly influencing the perception of the space and creating extraordinary sensations for passersby. Ensuring environmental responsibility and fostering a culture of sustainability among people are vital in making this space enduring and eco-friendly.\n' +

'SLC:<br>\n' +
'The eight-story building stands as Ryerson's new face on Yonge Street. Its design features a captivating glass facade, an elevated plaza, and a bridge connecting to the existing library, offering a range of academic, study, and collaboration spaces. The special access, achieved through a blend of ramps and stairs, elevates the building, giving it hierarchy and making it stand out in the cityscape. This design creates a fresh, modern ambiance that enhances its openness to the downtown area. Notably, each floor incorporates a different theme, bringing the atmosphere of various ecosystems to the interior, resulting in a flexible and dynamic space adaptable to different needs. Moreover, the incorporation of biophilic architecture, reflected in interior proposals, furniture, and more, contributes to climate change mitigation and enhances mental well-being.\n' +
